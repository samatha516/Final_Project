# Final_Project
LendingClub is a US peer-to-peer lending company, headquartered in San Francisco, California. It was the first peer-to-peer lender to register its offerings as securities with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), and to offer loan trading on a secondary market. LendingClub is the world's largest peer-to-peer lending platform.

Our Goal
Given historical data on loans given out with information on whether or not the borrower defaulted (charge-off), can we build a model that can predict whether or not a borrower will pay back their loan? This way in the future when we get a new potential customer we can assess whether or not they are likely to pay back the loan. 

- Data Source: Kaggle
    - We were able to collect the data for the project from Kaggle. Input had loans information from year 2007 throguh 2018.
