            <p>LendingClub is a US peer-to-peer lending company, headquartered in San Francisco, California. It was the
              first peer-to-peer lender to register its offerings as securities with the Securities and Exchange
              Commission (SEC), and to offer loan trading on a secondary market. LendingClub is the world's largest
              peer-to-peer lending platform.</p>
            <p>Our Goal, given historical data on loans given out with information on whether or not the borrower
              defaulted (charge-off), can we build a model that can predict whether or not a borrower will pay back
              their loan? This way in the future when we get a new potential customer we can assess whether or not
              they are likely to pay back the loan.</p>

            <p><img src="assets/images/loan status by sub grade.png" alt="" id="description-image" /></p>
            <p>We are using data available to us on <a href="https://www.kaggle.com/wordsforthewise/lending-club">Kaggle</a>
              which was compressed using
              gzip. This was done to reduce the overall size while working. The original data file is removed from
              our github due to size limitations, however our final cleaned data is provided for individual use.
            </p>
            <p>After reviewing the original file, we noticed many columns contained NaN data entries or contained
              data not directly related to the loan status column. With this in mind, columns that contained 50%+
              NaN data enties were removed from the dataframe. From there each additional column was reviewed for
              it's impact on the loan status. A sample plot is provided to help understand the analysis done on
              each remaining column.</p>
            <p>Once all necessary columns had been identified, a csv was exported and compressed to help reduce the
              amount of space needed. Overall we were able to keep over 1 million rows of data from 2007 to 2018.

            <p>Taking the cleaned csv, addition encoding needed to take place before working on our Machine Learning
              Models. Using the <a
                href="https://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/user_guide/categorical.html">Categorical Data
                type in pandas</a>, we were able to encode the exisiting object data type columns.</p>
            <p>One model we chose to test was the Logisitic Regression model using tensorflow, sklearn and keras
              libraries. Setting up the model to have 21 inputs, two layers of connecting units and two outputs,
              the model performed at an 80.54% accuracy. When pulling samples from the test data, usually one or
              two predictions would be wrong in the set. Not being satisfied with only one model, we performed two
              other tests.</p>

            <p>The purpose of this project was to analyze how weather changes as you get closer to the equator. To
              accomplish this analysis, we first pulled data from the OpenWeatherMap API to assemble a dataset on over 500
              cities.</p>
            <p>After assembling the dataset, we used Matplotlib to plot various aspects of the weather vs. latitude. Factors
              we looked at included: temperature, cloudiness, wind speed, and humidity. This site provides the source data
              and visualizations created as part of the analysis, as well as explanations and descriptions of any trends and
              correlations witnessed.</p>

            <img src="assets/images/rf.png" alt="" id="description-image" />
            <p>The Random Forests model in simple terms, is a collection of multiple decision trees. Each tree uses a random number
              of features to make a classification prediction, and the classification with the most votes is returned by the model. 
              We used Sklearn's RandomForestClassifier.</p>
            <h2>Data Pre-Processing for the Model</h2>
            <img src="assets/images/encoding.png" alt="" id="label-encoding-image" />  
            <p>
              <strong>Label Encoding:</strong> As was done in another model, the categorical string values were encoded
              to numerical values using Sklearn's LabelEncoder tool.
              <strong>Resampling:</strong> Our dataset was unbalanced for the target value so we used sklearn's resample tool to
              balance the dataset. 
            </p>
            <img src="assets/images/rf-results.png" alt="" id="description-image" />
            <h2>Train, Validation, Test</h2>
            <p>After pre-processing, we used Sklearn's train_test_split method twice to split the data into training, validation, and
              testing groups in a 60/20/20 ratio.<br>
              We trained our random forest classifier on the training dataset and then used the validation set to tune our model. We
              used Sklearn's GridSearchCV tool to hypertune the parameters for the random forest classifier. After resampling and 
              hypertuning we received an accuracy of 91%. Using Sklearn's built-in feature importance tool we were also able to see the 
              most important features the model used for the predictions.</p>
